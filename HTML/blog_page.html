							Hello, I go by the psuedoname <b>Xcryptic Xoala</b>! I am an aspiring developer.
							So what's up with the name? Beats me I just came up with it on the spot!
							I haven't always been interested in coding, or computers in general.
							My first <em>'dream'</em> so to speak was to be a world famous soccer player
							believe it or not. Long story short it didn't work out and now I am
							currently in a IT position on the projects team for a well known company.
							But, like most people, I want more money as well as an oppurtunity for a new start!
							Also, developers are in need now more than ever so when <u>Udacity</u> offered
							me a scholarship to learn Front End Web Developement I hopped at the chance
							to chase a new dream. So after graduating from the Udacity cohort I plan to
							apply to become a front end engineer for a minor (or major if I'm lucky)
							league soccer team. Whether it be in the US or abroad! I also would like to
							try my hand at game development and hopefully be able to turn this project
							page into my own portfolio site/blog. So as a learn more as a developer I
							will be adding new features as time goes on and hopefully land me a dream job!
